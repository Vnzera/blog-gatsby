Mental health and education are very connected so separating the two introduces inefficiencies that negatively affect people's lives and the quality of their education. For example, if colleges do not screen students for conditions such as ADHD then students may end up struggling through courses, or progressing at a slower pace, because they do not have the treatment or even the diagnosis that they need to succeed. 

Colleges should be required to offer therapy and psychiatric services or at least basic screening services so that recommendations and referrals can be made. No one should have to find out that they have ADHD in their thirties long after they could have used the help.
