Here is a free code for a course on Udemy although it may be expired by now. The link is below. Udemy often has sales where courses go for $10 and you can get a refund easily within 30 days if you're not satisfied.

The course includes code along lectures on popular tech like TypeScript, TypeORM and Postgres. There is also a bonus lecture on deployment to AWS. The NestJS framework itself was inspired by Angular and the patterns it uses are worth learning.

My approach so far is to take notes using my own words as I go through the concepts. The lectures have been very easy to understand so far since I've worked with Node and MongoDB before. Definitely looking forward to putting my learning to the test. Follow me on Github.com/zdrifted to see my progress.
