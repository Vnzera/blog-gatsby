My Volkswagen had been sitting in the driveway for months because I couldn't afford to get it diagnosed and fixed. I somehow got lucky on one of my internet searches and found out my car has a 150k mile warranty on emissions related parts. This is something that I should have been informed of by one of the auto shops who serviced my car. I'm glad I was able to eventually take advantage of this little known warranty but this issue reminds me that there are major problems with the current automotive services being provided by the market.

This makes me wonder if a universal car care program would be more efficient. A lot of innovation is publicly funded already so why not extend this into the automotive industry? It could save a lot of time and money if we knew that every registered car was completely covered for all repairs until let's say 300k miles. There would be much lower costs associated with customers postponing repairs due to financial worries and there would be less stress and anxiety when it comes to the used car market. It's also uncertain how many accidents could have been prevented if the vehicles involved had been properly maintained.
