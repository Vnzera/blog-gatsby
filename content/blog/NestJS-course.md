Here is a free code for a course on Udemy. The link is below. Hopefully it still works but you can always get a refund if you don't like the course.

The course includes lectures on some popular tech like TypeScript, TypeORM and Postgres. There is also a bonus lecture on deployment to AWS. The NestJS framework itself was inspired by Angular and the patterns it uses could be worth learning especially if you're unfamiliar with Angular like I am.

My approach so far is to take notes using my own words as I go through the concepts. The lectures have been very easy to understand so far since I've worked with Node and MongoDB before. Definitely looking forward to putting my learning to the test. I've been thinking of building a for tracking a user's high scores for something like a Simon Game. We'll see.
