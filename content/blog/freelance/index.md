Freelancing is appealing to many because of the freedom it gives you to choose your hours, clients, projects and location. I ultimately want to try out #vanlife because you don't have to be tied down to a location. You have the freedom to move easily and avoid the ridiculous rent and housing payments. Being able to adapt and live a minimal life is important to me because it helps counter the leverage that others try to hold against you through employment and housing and other necessities. Skills that are in demand can land you side gigs which can provide a bit of insurance against unexpected expenses, job loss or work environments that become toxic.

These are just some of the reasons I purchased the [Freelancing and Beyond](https://studywebdevelopment.com/freelancing.html) course by Kyle Prinsloo. The course includes access to a Facebook group where Kyle is actually active. Little by little, anyone can build up the knowledge they need to start freelancing and there are many support groups out there where you can reach out for help. Thanks for reading!
