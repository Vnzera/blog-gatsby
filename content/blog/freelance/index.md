Freelancing has always been very appealing to me because of the freedom it gives you to choose your hours, clients, projects and location. I ultimately want to try out #vanlife because you don't have to be tied down to a location. You have the freedom to move easily and avoid the ridiculous rent and housing payments. Being able to adapt and live a minimal life is important to me because it helps counter the leverage that others try to hold against you through employment and housing and other necessities.

These are just some of the reasons I purchased the [Freelancing and Beyond](https://studywebdevelopment.com/freelancing.html) course by Kyle Prinsloo. I haven't finished reading through the e-book yet but I can already tell Kyle knows what he is talking about. The course also includes access to a Facebook group where Kyle is actually active. Little by little, I am going build up the knowledge I need to start my own freelancing business. Thanks for reading!
